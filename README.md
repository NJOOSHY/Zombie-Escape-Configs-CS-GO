# CSGO Zombie Escape Configs/Stripper Used On GhostCap Gaming Servers
Here you will find a list of EntWatch and Stripper configs for use with CSGO Zombie Escape servers. These are only our public configs and are not always 100% up to date with what we have on the main server.

We are starting to update this more frequently to help the ZE community and future server owners.

## Read This Before Adding New Strippers: 
When it comes to using Linux, things ARE case sensitive and MUST match the map name (This is not a problem with Windows servers). As we leave map names as the mapper intended, your config files must match the name on the map list provided here: https://forums.ghostcap.com/topic/27-csgo-zombie-escape-map-list-request-maps-here/

## Software You Need: 
Here is a list of the software that we use on our server to read these config files.
